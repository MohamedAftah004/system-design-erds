# System Design ERDs

This repository contains a collection of **ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) designs** created while practicing and improving my system design and data modeling skills.

The focus here is on translating written business requirements into clear, structured, and extensible database schemas.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

- Practice real-world data modeling
- Improve understanding of relationships and constraints
- Think about scalability and future changes early in the design

These ERDs are not tied to a specific framework or ORM. They are purely focused on **designing the data model**.

## Repository Structure

```
system-design-erds/
├── maintenance-service-system/
    ├── erd.png
    └── README.md

```

Each folder represents a separate case study and includes:

- An ERD diagram
- Short notes explaining the main design choices

---

## Design Approach

While designing the ERDs, I try to:

- Start strictly from the given requirements
- Avoid unnecessary tables or premature optimizations
- Use proper relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many)
- Keep business states extensible by modeling them as tables
- Consider future changes where reasonable

---

## Notes

These designs are part of an ongoing learning process.
Some decisions may evolve over time as my understanding improves.

Feedback and suggestions are always welcome.
